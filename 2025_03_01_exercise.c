// Your challenge is to modify the code presented to have the strstr() function continue to search the given string. 
// Remember, the value the function returns is an offset (pointer) into the string where the first match is found. 
// Itâ€™s possible to call the function a second time to continue the search
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void)
{
	char phrase[] = "Was this the face that launch'd a thousand ships, and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?";
	char find[] = "the";
	char *found;

	puts(phrase);
	found = strstr(phrase, find);
	printf("Found '%s' at offset %d.\n", find, (int)(found-phrase));

	return 0;
